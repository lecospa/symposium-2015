<p>Apart from the above included support files, this project requires other packages which are by default should available in a good LaTeX2e implementation. If any error message is prompted for a missing package, you can try to download them from a <a href="https://www.ctan.org/search/">CTAN host</a>.</p>
<p>ws-procs961x669.tex, is the sample file coded in LATEX2e to enable authors to use it as a template and for ready reference. ws-procs961x669.tex uses BIBTEX database to produce the bibliography list.</p>
<p>Getting Help Although a lot of effort has been put in to keep the document style easy to use and provide a concise description of the most common aspects of style, it is of course possible that authors encounter problems. Also authors might have suggestions for improvement. In those cases they can email their comments and suggestions to either of the following: <a href="mailto:ykoh@wspc.com.sg">ykoh@wspc.com.sg</a>, <a href="mailto:rajesh@wspc.com.sg">rajesh@wspc.com.sg</a></p>

<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>World Scientific has produced a style/template document for MSWord, which will allow authors to prepare manuscripts that can be brought directly into the World Scientific production process for CRC titles of the proceeding size [9.61in x 6.69in]. This will enable more accurate production of page proofs, reducing your need during proofreading to locate typographic mistakes.</p>
<p><u>Word Template Style Guide</u></p>
<p>The World Scientific Word templates and sample files are located on the website in a zip format called ws-procs961x669_word.zip. Download and unzip this. Once unzipped successfully, you will find the following files:</p>

<p class="larger-font">Shi-Yan Cultural Restaurant could   be described   as   one   of  Taipei's   premier examples  of  that  culinary  trend  for  its use  of  traditional,  local  ingredients  and styles and prepared to appeal to today's increasingly   health-conscious   and refined   Taiwanese   palate.&nbsp;
		Meals   are relatively  low  in  oil  and  salt  and  have plenty of vegetables.</p>

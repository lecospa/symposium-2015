<h2 id="author-manuscript-submission-guidelines">Author Manuscript Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Manuscripts of regular issues are submitted <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/ijmpd/login.asp">online</a> via <strong>Editorial Manager</strong> (EM), a fully web-based submission, peer-review, and tracking system.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are submitting via this system for the first time, you will first be required to <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/ijmpd/preRegistration.asp">register</a>. You are encouraged to include in your user information the ORCID (<a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a>) or register for one if you don't have it already. This ID will help to identify you in the researcher community and make it easier to keep track of all your publications.</li>
	<li>From the account you create, you will be able to monitor your submission and make subsequent submissions.</li>
	<li>Authors are encouraged to format their contributions using <strong>Latex2e</strong> according to the detailed instructions provided in this <a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/sda/1037/ijmpd-2e.zip">download</a> (<a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/page/ijmpd/stylefiles-readme-2e">readme</a>).</li>
	<li>The <span style="color:red"><strong>minimum requirement</strong> is for manuscripts to be prepared according to the following guidelines.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-guidelines">Detailed Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Submission of a manuscript indicates a tacit understanding that the paper is not under consideration for publication with other journals. Once a paper is accepted, authors are assumed to have transferred the copyright of the paper to World Scientific. Authors are encouraged to include their funding information in the submission to facilitate the potential conversion to open access once the paper is accepted.</li>
	<li>All submitted articles will be acknowledged and articles that are to be considered for publication will be refereed. Authors may recommend appropriate persons as referees for their papers, but this in no way binds the editors to follow their suggestions. Authors may also request to remain anonymous to the referees.</li>
	<li>The manuscript, including the abstract, references, tables, figures and figure captions, should be clearly typed in English, double-spaced for A4 or letter-sized paper, with an ample margin around the text.</li>
	<li>Legible, compact notation should be used so long as it conforms to current practice. Each symbol must be clear, either typed neatly or written in ink and properly aligned to distinguish superscripts and subscripts. Vectors are denoted by arrows at the top, or should be in bold. Sections and subsections of a paper are numbered with Arabic numerals; so are tables and figures. Each page of the manuscript should be numbered at the top.</li>
	<li>References are numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals, in the order of first appearance, and are designated by numbered superscripts in the text. They should be listed at the end of the text. The general format preferred is as follows:
		<ol>
			<li>F. Wilczek, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 7 (1992) 3911.</li>
			<li>J. D. Bjorken, in Lecture Notes on Current-Induced Reactions, eds. J. Komeret al. (Springer, Heidelberg, 1975).</li>
			<li>A. Bohr and B. R. Mottelson, Nuclear Structure, Vol. 1 (Benjamin, New York, 1969), pp. 100-102.</li>
			<li>R. C. Webb, PhD thesis, Princeton University, 1972.</li>
			<li>T. Toimela, Helsinki Research Institute for Theoretical Physics, Report No. HU-TFT-82-37, 1982 (unpublished).</li>
			<li>I. L. Shapiro and J. Sola, hep-ph/0104182.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Footnotes, other than those referring to acknowledgments and information on grants, should be labelled alphabetically and placed at the bottom of the manuscript page (and not listed separately).</li>
	<li>Tables and figures are also numbered in the order in which they are cited in the text. Figures, which may be embedded in the text or separate, should be black and white (or half-tone) and of a good resolution and sharpness. Compressed formats, such as JPEG, should not use heavy compression, which introduces undesirable artifacts. Bitmap figures, such as photographs or half-tone images, should be at least 300dpi (TIFF, BMP, or JPEG). Vector (line-art) figures, such as charts and technical drawings, should be 600-1200dpi (EPS, PS, PDF). The native formats of software packages will not be permitted.</li>
	<li>A condensed paper title (for running heads) should also be provided.</li>
	<li>Papers submitted will not be returned to the authors. There is no page charge.</li>
	<li>Authors receive FREE PDFs of their published articles (rather than free paper offprints). Authors who would like paper offprints will still be able to order them at reasonable rates (please request an order form).</li>
	<p style="color:red"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Visit our <a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/page/authors/author-rights">Author Rights</a> page to find out about the permissions given to authors to use their PDFs as well as their submitted or accepted preprint articles.</p>

<p>Apart from the above included support files, this project requires other packages which are by default should available in a good LaTeX2e implementation. If any error message is prompted for a missing package, you can try to download them from a <a href="https://www.ctan.org/search/">CTAN host</a>.</p>
<p>ws-procs961x669.tex, is the sample file coded in LATEX2e to enable authors to use it as a template and for ready reference. ws-procs961x669.tex uses BIBTEX database to produce the bibliography list.</p>
<p>Getting Help Although a lot of effort has been put in to keep the document style easy to use and provide a concise description of the most common aspects of style, it is of course possible that authors encounter problems. Also authors might have suggestions for improvement. In those cases they can email their comments and suggestions to either of the following: <a href="mailto:ykoh@wspc.com.sg">ykoh@wspc.com.sg</a>, <a href="mailto:rajesh@wspc.com.sg">rajesh@wspc.com.sg</a></p>

<h3>2. Method B: MS-Word (<a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/sda/1020/ws-procs961x669_word.zip">download</a>)</h3>
<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>World Scientific has produced a style/template document for MSWord, which will allow authors to prepare manuscripts that can be brought directly into the World Scientific production process for CRC titles of the proceeding size [9.61in x 6.69in]. This will enable more accurate production of page proofs, reducing your need during proofreading to locate typographic mistakes.</p>
<p><u>Word Template Style Guide</u></p>
<p>The World Scientific Word templates and sample files are located on the website in a zip format called ws-procs961x669_word.zip. Download and unzip this. Once unzipped successfully, you will find the following files:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>procs-readme961x669_word.pdf :</td>
		<td>preliminary guide</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>procs-instruction961x669_word :</td>
		<td>general instructions</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ws-procs961x669_word.dotm :</td>
		<td>style / template file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ws-procs961x669_word.pdf :</td>
		<td>PDF version of ws-procs961x669_word.dotm</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The template can be retained in the current working folder and double clicking it should open a new document based on our styles. Now just overwrite its contents with your text, save and continue editing / styling as required.</p>
<h2 id="page-limits-for-articles">Page Limits for Articles</h2>
<p>Plenary speakers may use up to approximately 10 pages per paper. Both topical Parallel session Organizers and parallel session speakers’ papers are limited to 6 pages.</p>
